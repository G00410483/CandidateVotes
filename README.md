# CandidateVotes
This program processes election vote data from five different states and determines the winners for each state as well as the overall winner of a city's mayoral election.


This C program is designed to assist in analyzing election vote data for a city's mayoral election. It performs the following tasks:

Input Vote Data: The program prompts the user to enter the vote counts for each candidate in five different states, resulting in a matrix of vote counts.

Print Vote Matrix: It displays the vote matrix in a tabular format both on the console and in a file named "CandidateVotes.txt."

Determine State Winners: For each state, the program identifies the candidate with the highest number of votes and prints their name as the state winner.

Determine City Winner: The program calculates the total votes for each candidate across all states and identifies the candidate with the highest total as the winner of the city's mayoral election.
